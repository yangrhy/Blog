                My name is Ricky Yang, I am currently a senior at Northeastern State University,
                working towards my second bachelor's in computer science. I will be posting about
                the adventures I have while working towards my goal of becoming a software engineer.

                    <p>
                        Here is what I've been able to come up with so far. Formatting 
                        isn't great, but the semester is starting to get busy.
                        Getting a chance to develop an application for a real company.
                        Excited for the opportunity, but I will have to come back 
                        and make this prettier when I have the time.

                    <p>
                        I am currently trying to learn some HTML to create my own personal website.
                        Hopefully later today, I will have time to continue learning CSS to add this site.
